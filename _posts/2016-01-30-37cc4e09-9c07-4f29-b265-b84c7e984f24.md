They say dreams are often best enjoyed when you turn them into reality. So thats what I've been chasing. For the past three years, a dream. Utter madness. Total impracticality. The turning point from dream to reality. 

It was never meant to be about getting from A-to-B. Never supposed to be thought of as time wasted. We've ruined it, the car, because we've forgotten its original intent; to thrill. To create a sense of emotion through mechanical wonder. To be the focus of an occasion. To wow us, to terrify us and to employ us to chase our dreams. It was always supposed to be about automotive theatre.
